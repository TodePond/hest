# TodePond/Hest
Welcome to the unofficial open source fan repo for Hest.

### What's Hest?
It's a concept for a visual programming system created by Ivan Reese. But beyond that, we're not really sure. That's why we're here!

### What an "open source fan repo"?
It's a place for fans of Hest to gather. We share our favourite Hest memes, theories about what's coming next for Hest, and mysterious third things. It's like a fansite or fanclub, but inside a repo.

### Why a fan repo for Hest?
Ivan Reese refuses to open source Hest (whatever it is), so we have decided to organize an unofficial independent community. If he won't make Hest public, we will.

### How can I help?
This repo belongs to you and me — the fans! We get to decide what Hest means to us. If you know something about Hest, submit a pull request. If you make something about Hest, submit a pull request. That's our motto!

> [Something] Hest? Pull request!

> we are proud to state that this repo is the most open-sourced hest has ever been in the history of mankind

# todepond/hest
welcome to the unofficial open source fan repo for hest.

## whats hest?
its a closed-source proprietrory (cant spell it) visual programming language created by ivan reese.

## whats an "unofficial open source repo"?
its a repo that open sources as much as it can from an otherwise closed source project

## why an unofficial open source repo for hest?
ivan reese refuses to open source hest, so we have decided to organise an unofficial open source repo. if he won't make hest open source, we will.

## is this allowed? 
probably, but as hest's license hasnt been open sourced anywhere, we cant know for sure.

## how can i help?
if you know have info or resources about hest, submit a pull request. if you make something about hest, submit a pull request.

> [something] hest? pull request!

So I was digging through some old data disks and found a new trove of info about Hest!

There was this one folder called "inspo". I expected to find a bunch of prior art, source material, references… but there was just some [AI art from 2022](https://twitter.com/disconcision/status/1606573390412017664) by someone named [Andrew Blinn](https://mastodon.social/@spiralganglion/112283974730498266). Disappointing.

But then I hit the jackpot! A folder of old Hest prototypes. And a planning document called "Big List of Things To Do (No Judgement Zone)"

I can't wait to check these out and see what they're all about!

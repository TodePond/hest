So I was digging through some old data disks and found a new trove of info about Hest!

There was this one folder called "inspo". I expected to find a bunch of prior art, source material, references… but there was just some AI art from 2022 by someone named Andrew Blinn. Disappointing.

But then I hit the jackpot! A folder of old Hest prototypes. And a planning document called "Big List of Things To Do (No Judgement Zone)"

I can't wait to check these out and see what they're all about!
